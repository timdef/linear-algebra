What is a function?; A mathmatical object that takes numbers has inputs and produces numbers as outputs.

What is the *domain* of a function?; The set of allowed input values.    
What is the *image* or *range* of a function?; The set of all possible output values for that function.  
What does the *codomain* of a function do?; Describes the type of outputs a function has.  
What do you call a function that maps different inputs to different outputs?; One-to-one or injective  
What do you call a function if it covers the entire output set? (image = codomain); Onto or surjective.  
When do you say a function is 'bijective'?; When it is both injective and surjective.  
What is the act of applying multiple functions together known as?; function composition  
What type of function is [$]f \circ g[/$]?; A composit function.  
How does an inverse function map?; The output of a function back to its starting point.
